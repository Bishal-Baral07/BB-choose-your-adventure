# Infirmary Alcove

A survivor lies beside a **spiritâ€‘bound charm** humming softly.  The charm is large and cumbersome, carrying both the survivor and charm will be difficult.  The survivor also has a **remote orb** that can give you information about the **Fallen Keep**, but it takes time.

**Decision:**
- :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: [Carry both the survivor and charm to the hall](./stabilize-dock.md)
- :heartpulse: [Stay where you are and use a remote orb](./remote-scan.md)
