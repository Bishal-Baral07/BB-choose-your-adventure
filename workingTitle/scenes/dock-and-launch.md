# Main Stair Descent

Cold air rises from the stairwell. Distant chains rattle. Your lantern sputters.

**Choose your approach:**
- :running: [Advance quickly through the rubbleâ€‘strewn corridor (risky, quick)](./fast-burn.md)
- :herb: [Circle safely via the mossy passage (slow, safer)](./safe-arc.md)
